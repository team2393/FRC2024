Timeline
--------

* 2024 Beta
  - See https://github.com/wpilibsuite/2024Beta
  - 2024 Beta versions of RoboRio image, WPILib, CTRE lib all "work" in initial tests,
    but command classes are slightly different and new swervelib additions,
    to best start over with new API
  - CTRE offers "Phoenix 5" and "Phoenix 6" API.
    Original Pigeon is only supported with v5.
    New Phoenix X Tuner can still see, update and plot devices with v5 firmware,
    so starting with that to remain compatible with all test hardware.
